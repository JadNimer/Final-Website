Website for my final project

1. Identify one problem you encountered in this unit (i.e., during the independent project, not before) and describe how you overcame it. This might be fixing a bug, implementing a feature, or understanding a new concept or skill. Include a code snippet along with your explanation.

One problem I encountered in this unit was aligning all the text on my home page. When it came to the specific information about each game and the headers, I kept having a problem where too much writing would make the rest of the text unaligned. To solve this, I used a harder method than what was necessary. First, I shortened the text, which solved the problem in some cases, and in others, it didn't work. So, I would margin-right the text and would keep testing different percentages until it worked. I later found a better method of using <br> which would have saved me a lot of time.

2. How has your understanding of computing changed since the beginning of the semester? Identify at least one specific piece of knowledge, concept, or attitude.

My understanding of computing has gone from almost nothing to a somewhat decent amount. I basically knew nothing about computers and coding in general when we started this course. I didn't really understand coding as a concept and the different components of computers. I have come to enjoy computing as it is fun and you get satisfaction from seeing the algorithm of code you wrote actually working. My attitude towards computing has become more positive and my knowledge of computers has increased. I now understand more about the reason computers actually function and how code plays a huge role in that.  

3. What new skills have you acquired this semester? Identify at least one thing you can do now that you could not do before taking the class.

A new skill that I acquired is coding, but more specifically making websites and identifying errors in a snippet of code. When we started this semester, I was clueless about how to code and thought that you could just code on Google Docs. Now, I am able to efficiently create websites and match them to the criteria they need to fit. Before this class, I couldn't code in the slightest, and now I can code and understand algorithms to a much greater extent. 

4. In what ways do computers improve our lives? Explain.

Computers improve all aspects of our lives whether we realize it or not. We are now able to do almost everything like shopping, getting groceries, and buying properties through our computers. Computers have made life simpler as we know it. Our communication has also improved tremendously. Computers allow for emailing, social media, and video calls which are all used in casual and professional settings. We are able to communicate with anyone around the globe in a matter of seconds. We can also access new information easily by looking it up. Even though you do that on your phone, the reason your phone functions and those applications exist is because of computers. 

5. In what ways would our lives be improved by removing computers from our lives? Explain

While we rely on computers a lot, removing them would improve our health and well-being. Computers can be addicting and cause you to lose the ability to differentiate between the real world and the digital world. Removing computers would allow people to go outside even more and socialize face-to-face even more. There would still be more negative effects than positive ones. 

6. Will being in this class have an impact on you in the future? In what way?

Being in this class will have an impact on me in the future. While it will help me in AP CSP, it will also help me with my future job. I aspire to be a software engineer and taking this class not only taught me to code but also taught me more about computers and how computers function. That knowledge is necessary to excel as a software engineer. This class will also impact me as I learn the skill of time management and not doing everything at once. While working, take breaks and review what you're doing.
